Theme: Limited Space

Idea 1:
- Single room top-down shooter where the walls are coming in, you have to kill enemies but also expand room
- Shrinking room pushes enemies towards you

Idea 2:
- Driving game where you are on a cliff side swervy road and have to avoid falling off
- Fast paced, as the game progresses more oncoming traffic spawns and you speed up

Idea 3:
- Black friday shopping, need to buy everything while getting through swarm
- Sooner you get stuff the better deal, final score is how much you spent

Idea 4:
- Escape room
